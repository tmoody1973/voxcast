### 🔧 **For Developers & Customizers**

If you need to modify the framework or contribute to development:

- **Framework Customization**: See the [User Guide - Development section](user-guide.md#-development-and-customization) for modifying agents and dependencies
- **Build Process**: Use `python3 scripts/build-bundle.py` to regenerate `publicradio.txt` after making changes
- **Technical Details**: Check [BUILD-BUNDLE-GUIDE.md](../BUILD-BUNDLE-GUIDE.md) for complete build system documentation

**Note**: Most users only need the ready-to-use `publicradio.txt` file. The build script is only needed if you're customizing the framework itself.
