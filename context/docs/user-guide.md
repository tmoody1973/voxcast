## 🔧 **Understanding and Customizing Agent Dependencies**

### **What Are Agent Dependencies?**

Agent dependencies are the specialized knowledge, tools, and resources that make each Public Radio Agent an expert in their field. Think of them as the agent's "toolkit" - the specific information, processes, and templates they use to provide expert guidance.

Each agent has four types of dependencies:
- **Data**: Knowledge bases and reference materials
- **Tasks**: Specific processes and workflows they can execute
- **Templates**: Structured formats for creating documents and plans
- **Checklists**: Step-by-step guides for complex procedures

### **How Dependencies Work**

When you consult with an agent, they automatically access their dependencies to provide expert guidance. For example, when the Underwriting Director helps with sponsor research, they use:
- Corporate partnership best practices (data)
- Prospect research process (task)
- Sponsorship proposal format (template)
- Compliance review steps (checklist)

### **Viewing Agent Dependencies**

To see what dependencies an agent has available, you can ask them directly:

```
*agent underwriting-director
What resources and tools do you have available to help with corporate partnerships?
```

The agent will list their available data sources, tasks, templates, and checklists.

---

## 📋 **Example: Underwriting Director Dependencies**

Here's how the Underwriting Director's dependencies are structured:

### **Data Dependencies (Knowledge Sources)**
```yaml
data:
  - public-radio-underwriting-kb.md          # General underwriting knowledge
  - fcc-underwriting-regulations.md          # Legal compliance requirements
  - corporate-partnership-best-practices.md  # Industry best practices
  - sponsorship-valuation-methods.md         # Pricing and value strategies
```

**What this means**: The agent has access to comprehensive knowledge about underwriting regulations, partnership strategies, and valuation methods.

### **Task Dependencies (Processes)**
```yaml
tasks:
  - advanced-elicitation.md              # Gathering detailed requirements
  - analyze-sponsorship-performance.md   # Evaluating campaign success
  - corporate-prospect-research.md       # Researching potential sponsors
  - create-doc.md                        # Document creation process
  - partnership-compliance-review.md     # Ensuring FCC compliance
  - sponsor-satisfaction-survey.md       # Measuring sponsor satisfaction
```

**What this means**: The agent can execute specific processes like researching prospects, analyzing performance, and conducting compliance reviews.

### **Template Dependencies (Document Formats)**
```yaml
templates:
  - client-stewardship-tmpl.yaml         # Sponsor relationship management
  - partnership-agreement-tmpl.yaml     # Contract templates
  - partnership-strategy-tmpl.yaml      # Strategic planning format
  - prospect-research-tmpl.yaml         # Research documentation
  - sales-pipeline-tmpl.yaml            # Sales tracking system
  - sponsor-benefits-tmpl.yaml          # Benefit package design
  - sponsor-event-tmpl.yaml             # Event planning format
  - sponsorship-proposal-tmpl.yaml      # Proposal structure
  - underwriting-guidelines-tmpl.yaml   # Internal guidelines
```

**What this means**: The agent can create professional documents using proven formats for proposals, agreements, and strategic plans.

### **Checklist Dependencies (Step-by-Step Guides)**
```yaml
checklists:
  - partnership-onboarding-checklist.md    # New sponsor setup process
  - proposal-development-checklist.md      # Creating winning proposals
  - sponsor-stewardship-checklist.md       # Maintaining relationships
  - compliance-review-checklist.md         # Ensuring legal compliance
```

**What this means**: The agent can guide you through complex processes step-by-step, ensuring nothing is missed.

## 🛠️ **How to Use Dependencies in Practice**

### **Accessing Specific Resources**

You can ask agents to use specific dependencies:

```
*agent underwriting-director
Use the prospect-research template to help me research potential sponsors in the healthcare sector for our health and wellness programming.
```

```
*agent underwriting-director
Walk me through the partnership-onboarding checklist for our new sponsor, Regional Bank.
```

### **Requesting Specific Tasks**

Ask agents to execute their specialized tasks:

```
*agent underwriting-director
Perform a sponsorship performance analysis for our Q3 campaigns using your analysis framework.
```

```
*agent underwriting-director
Help me create a partnership strategy for expanding our corporate support using your strategic planning process.
```

### **Combining Multiple Dependencies**

Agents can use multiple dependencies together:

```

## 🔧 **Understanding the Build Script (For Technical Users)**

### **What is the build-bundle.py Script?**

The `build-bundle.py` script is a tool that creates the complete `publicradio.txt` file from individual agent files and their resources. Think of it like assembling a complete manual from separate chapters.

### **When Do You Need the Build Script?**

**✅ You NEED to use the build script if you want to:**
- Add new capabilities to existing agents (Development, Marketing, etc.)
- Create custom templates specific to your station's needs
- Add specialized knowledge bases for your market or region
- Modify agent personalities or approaches
- Create custom workflows for your station's unique processes

**⛔ You DON'T need the build script if you're:**
- Just using the framework as-is with ChatGPT, Claude, or other AI services
- Following the quick start guide normally
- Using the SaaS frontend (it uses the framework automatically)

### **How to Use the Build Script**

**Step 1: Make Sure You Have What You Need**
- Python 3.6 or newer installed on your computer
- The PyYAML package: `pip install pyyaml`

**Step 2: Make Your Changes**
- Edit files in the `agents/` folder to modify agent configurations
- Add new files in `agents/dependencies/` folders for custom resources
- Create new templates, checklists, or knowledge files as needed

**Step 3: Run the Build Script**
```bash
# From the main project directory
python3 scripts/build-bundle.py
```

**Step 4: Test Your Changes**
- The script creates a new `publicradio.txt` file
- Upload this file to your AI service (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Test that your changes work as expected

### **Real-World Examples**

**Example 1: Adding Local Market Knowledge**
*Scenario*: You want to add information about your local business community to help with underwriting.

1. Create a new file: `agents/dependencies/underwriting-director/data/local-business-landscape.md`
2. Add your market-specific information
3. Update the underwriting agent configuration to reference this file
4. Run `python3 scripts/build-bundle.py`
5. Use the new `publicradio.txt` file

**Example 2: Custom Membership Campaign Template**
*Scenario*: Your station has a unique approach to membership campaigns that works well.

1. Create: `agents/dependencies/development-director/templates/custom-membership-strategy.yaml`
2. Add your proven template structure
3. Reference it in the development director's configuration
4. Run the build script
5. Now the Development Director knows your specific approach

**Example 3: Regional Compliance Requirements**
*Scenario*: Your state has specific regulations that agents should know about.

1. Create: `agents/dependencies/program-director/data/state-broadcasting-regulations.md`
2. Add your state-specific requirements
3. Update the program director configuration
4. Build and test

### **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

**"Missing dependency file" errors:**
- Make sure file paths in agent configurations match actual file names exactly
- Check that file extensions are correct (.md for text, .yaml for templates)

**"Permission denied" errors:**
- Make sure you have write permissions in the project directory
- Try running from the correct directory (the main project folder)

**Build succeeds but changes don't appear:**
- Verify you're using the newly created `publicradio.txt` file
- Clear any cached versions in your AI service

### **Quality Assurance**

Always validate your changes:
```bash
python3 scripts/validate-dependencies.py
```

This checks for errors and helps ensure everything is properly connected.

### **Advanced Usage**

**Custom Output Location:**
```bash
python3 scripts/build-bundle.py --output my-custom-bundle.txt
```

**For Development Teams:**
1. Make changes in a separate branch
2. Build and test thoroughly
3. Validate with the validation script
4. Share with your team for review before merging
