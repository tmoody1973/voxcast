# Station Console: Feature Prioritization Brainstorming Session

**Session Date:** January 8, 2026
**Facilitator:** Mary (BMAD Business Analyst)
**Participant:** Tarik Moody
**Session Type:** Broad Exploration — Feature Prioritization Beyond PRD Roadmap

---

## Executive Summary

### Session Topic and Goals
Explore feature opportunities for Station Console beyond the existing PRD roadmap, with a focus on uncovering unmet needs across all station roles through deep persona immersion.

### Techniques Used
- **Role Playing** (Primary technique — deep immersion across 5 station personas)
- Duration: Extended session with full exploration of each role

### Total Ideas Generated
- **34 distinct feature capabilities** identified
- **5 persona perspectives** fully explored
- **1 architectural insight** (Station Pulse / Chief of Staff layer)

### Key Themes and Patterns Identified

1. **The Preparation Problem** — Everyone needs role-specific intelligence briefs before meetings, decisions, and events
2. **The Institutional Memory Problem** — Critical knowledge lives in people's heads, not systems
3. **The Signal Correlation Problem** — Each department sees their piece; no one sees the whole board
4. **The Evidence Problem** — Everyone needs to prove value but lacks the data to do it

---

## Technique Sections

### Role Playing: General Manager

**Persona Context:** Station leader responsible for overall performance, board relations, and strategic direction.

**Key Question Explored:** "What would make your job fundamentally different?"

**Ideas Generated:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Daily Briefing | Prioritized intelligence with recommended actions, not dashboards |
| Multi-Signal Correlation | Connect signals across departments that individually seem minor |
| Collision Detection | Flag when one department's decision affects another |
| Momentum Tracking | What's gaining steam, losing steam, gone quiet |
| Decay Detection | Relationship erosion signals before they break |
| External Intelligence | Industry news, competitive moves, market shifts |

**Insights Discovered:**
- The GM doesn't need more data — they need a "Chief of Staff" layer that watches the whole organization
- Five specific collision types identified: Programming↔Development, Marketing↔Underwriting, Events↔ROI, Content↔Membership, Grant Narrative↔Reality
- "Silence is a signal" — the absence of engagement is as important as negative engagement

**Notable Connections:**
- The GM's need for cross-department visibility became the architectural foundation for "Station Pulse"
- Early warning system concept connects to all other personas' needs

**Key Quote:** *"I don't need dashboards. I need to know what's about to break before it breaks."*

### Role Playing: Development Director

**Persona Context:** Leads fundraising, donor relations, major gifts, and fundraising events (HYFIN Gala, Fall Ball, etc.).

**Key Question Explored:** "What's the thing that keeps you up at night?"

**Ideas Generated:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Quiet Attrition Detection | Surface donors going cold before they lapse |
| 60-Second Donor Prep | One-pager before any interaction: Relationship Snapshot, What They Care About, Landmines, The Opening, Ask Context |
| Living Narrative Library | One truth, multiple audience-specific expressions |
| Relationship Momentum Scores | Are we getting closer or drifting apart? |
| Event Intelligence Dashboard | Pre-event attendee analysis: giving history, renewal status, who needs attention |
| Table/Seating Strategy | Strategic seating based on relationship data and prospect status |
| Event ROI Tracking | What did this event actually produce? |
| Post-Event Follow-up Queue | Prioritized outreach list after events |
| Event-to-Gift Attribution | Track when event attendance leads to giving |
| Event History per Donor | Which events have they attended? Patterns? |

**Insights Discovered:**
- "Who have I forgotten?" is the central anxiety — the quiet attrition problem
- The Development Director is the station's institutional memory, but that knowledge is trapped in one person's head
- Events are cultivation touchpoints, not just revenue moments — need full intelligence before, during, and after
- "She's my institutional memory" — Sarah needs to externalize that memory into the system

**Notable Connections:**
- Donor prep format (5 sections) could be templated across all roles
- Event intelligence connects to Programming (talent, content) and Underwriting (sponsor presence)

**Key Quote:** *"Help me remember what I can't possibly hold in my head."*

### Role Playing: Marketing Director

**Persona Context:** Leads brand, communications, audience development, and multi-channel marketing with limited resources.

**Key Question Explored:** "What's the thing under the thing — the problem beneath the symptoms?"

**Ideas Generated:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Audience Reality Map | Who's actually listening/engaging vs. who we think we serve |
| Adjacent Audience Mapping | Who could we be for with slight pivots |
| Journey Intelligence | Pathways from unaware → aware → engaged → member → sustaining |
| Channel Efficiency Analysis | What to sunset, what to double down on |
| Role Clarity Canvas | Own / Influence / Stop boundaries |
| Strategic Filter | Framework for saying no to requests |
| Campaign Impact Attribution | What actually moved the needle? |

**Insights Discovered:**
- "Who are we actually for anymore?" — fundamental audience identity crisis
- The Marketing Director is accountable for everything but in control of almost nothing
- Needs to "kill something on Monday" — permission and evidence to stop ineffective work
- Four changes for Monday: filter for saying no, kill something, funnel thinking, real briefs

**Notable Connections:**
- Audience Reality Map feeds Programming decisions (who are we programming for?)
- Journey Intelligence connects to Development (when does listener become donor?)
- Channel efficiency analysis could inform Underwriting (where should sponsors be?)

**Key Quote:** *"I'm accountable for everything and in control of almost nothing."*

### Role Playing: Underwriting Director

**Persona Context:** Leads corporate sponsorship sales, manages sponsor relationships, responsible for underwriting revenue.

**Key Question Explored:** "What's the fundamental challenge of your role right now?"

**Ideas Generated:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Listener Impact Survey System | Generate evidence/proof for sponsors |
| Pipeline Intelligence | Prioritized opportunities, not junk drawer |
| Proposal Generator | 80% complete proposals from templates + history |
| Renewal Briefs | What happened since last contract — talking points, performance |
| Call Prep Sheets | One-pager before any client meeting |
| Sales Playbook | Institutional knowledge for training + succession |
| Engagement Decay Alerts | When sponsor interaction drops off |
| Competitive Intelligence | What are other stations/media offering? |

**Insights Discovered:**
- "Selling 20th-century product in 21st-century market" — fundamental evidence problem
- Can't prove ROI like digital competitors can
- Pipeline is a "junk drawer" — everything's in there but nothing's prioritized
- "Build the machine so I can stop being the machine" — knowledge is trapped in the sales director

**Notable Connections:**
- Engagement Decay Alerts feed into Station Pulse early warning system
- Renewal Briefs need Programming data (what aired during their sponsorship)
- Proposal Generator needs Marketing assets and audience data

**Key Quote:** *"Help me build the machine so I can stop being the machine."*

### Role Playing: Program Director

**Persona Context:** Leads content strategy, scheduling, host management, and external partnership opportunities.

**Key Question Explored:** "What's the actual relationship between what you air and what the station is trying to accomplish?"

**Ideas Generated:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Consequence Preview | One-page impact forecast before any programming decision |
| Show Profile Dashboard | Audience + Development + Underwriting + Marketing + Grant exposure in one view |
| Outcome Tagging | Classify shows: reach plays, conversion plays, brand plays, revenue plays |
| Listener-Supporter Bridge | Connect anonymous streams to known members/donors |
| Listening Journey Maps | Patterns over time, not snapshots |
| Conversion Attribution | What did they listen to before becoming a sustainer? |
| Decision Confidence Signals | Green light vs. flags requiring cross-department conversation |
| Partnership Pipeline | Track external partnership opportunities in discussion |
| Partner Profile | Organization history, audience overlap, strategic fit |
| Partnership Value Assessment | What's the upside? Audience, revenue, brand alignment |
| Collaboration Calendar | Partnership windows, scheduling conflicts, production timelines |
| Partnership ROI Tracking | What did partnerships actually deliver? |
| Cross-Department Impact Check | Does this partnership affect Development, Marketing, Underwriting? |

**Insights Discovered:**
- Programming "in the dark" — can't tell which shows drive growth vs. retain vs. convert
- "Doors vs. furniture" — some shows bring people in, others keep them comfortable, but can't tell which is which
- $5,000 donor lost due to schedule change with no visibility into who cared about that show
- "I become a programmer again" — wants to stop being politician/archaeologist/hostage negotiator
- Partnerships are programming decisions with external dependencies — need pipeline view

**Notable Connections:**
- Consequence Preview is the synthesis of all other agents' data
- Partnership opportunities may conflict with Development events or Underwriting relationships
- Show Outcome Tagging reframes how the entire station values content

**Key Quote:** *"I stop programming for audience. I start programming for outcome."*

   - Multi-signal correlation
   - Collision detection
   - Momentum tracking

2. **Living Narrative Library (Development)** — One truth, audience-specific expressions

3. **Audience Reality Map (Marketing)** — Who's actually listening vs. who we think we serve

4. **Show Outcome Tagging (Programming)** — Classify shows by strategic purpose

5. **Event ROI Tracking (Development)** — Full attribution from event attendance to giving

6. **Partnership Pipeline (Programming)** — Track external opportunities and collaborations

### Moonshots
*Ambitious, transformative concepts requiring significant infrastructure*

1. **Listener-Supporter Bridge** — Connect anonymous streaming data to known members/donors
   - Requires: Identity resolution, privacy considerations, data infrastructure
   - Payoff: Finally answer "who are my most valuable listeners?"

2. **Full Journey Intelligence** — Track complete path from unaware → sustaining member
   - Requires: Cross-platform tracking, CRM integration, attribution modeling
   - Payoff: Optimize every touchpoint for conversion

3. **Conversion Attribution** — What did they listen to before becoming a sustainer?
   - Requires: Listening data linked to membership data
   - Payoff: Program for outcomes, not just ratings

4. **Predictive Decay Detection** — AI-powered early warning for relationship erosion
   - Requires: Historical pattern analysis, signal weighting
   - Payoff: Intervene before relationships break

### Insights & Learnings
*Key realizations from the session*

1. **Agents must interconnect** — The PRD describes parallel agents; the session revealed they need to work in concert with shared intelligence

2. **Preparation is universal** — Every role needs context before they act; the format differs but the need is identical

3. **Institutional memory is the hidden asset** — Every director is carrying critical knowledge in their head that could disappear tomorrow

4. **Evidence is everyone's problem** — Development needs to prove donor impact, Underwriting needs to prove sponsor ROI, Marketing needs to prove campaign effectiveness, Programming needs to prove content value

5. **Events and Partnerships are underserved** — Both involve external relationship management, pipeline tracking, and cross-department implications that aren't addressed in current tooling

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### Priority 1: Station Pulse (Chief of Staff Layer)
**Rationale:** Architectural foundation — without cross-agent intelligence sharing, each agent operates in a silo and the highest-value insights (cross-department signals) are missed.

**Next Steps:**
- Define the signal taxonomy (what data does each agent contribute?)
- Design the correlation engine (how do we detect meaningful patterns?)
- Create the Daily Briefing format and information hierarchy
- Build collision detection rules for the 5 identified collision types

**Resources Needed:**
- Data architecture for cross-agent communication
- UX design for GM-level briefing interface
- Signal weighting and priority algorithms

---

#### Priority 2: Prep Briefs System (All Roles)
**Rationale:** Immediate value for every user, relatively low complexity, solves a universal pain point articulated by every persona.

**Next Steps:**
- Define brief templates for each role (Donor Prep, Call Prep, Event Intel, Consequence Preview)
- Identify data sources for each brief type
- Design the trigger logic (when does a brief get generated?)
- Build the one-page output format

**Resources Needed:**
- Template design per role
- Data integration from CRM, event systems, programming schedules
- Mobile-friendly output format

---

#### Priority 3: Consequence Preview (Programming)
**Rationale:** Prevents costly mistakes (the $5K donor story), provides immediate GM-visible value, and demonstrates cross-agent intelligence in action.

**Next Steps:**
- Define the Show Profile data structure
- Map data sources: Nielsen, streaming, Development CRM, Underwriting contracts, Grant narratives
- Design the Consequence Forecast algorithm (risk assessment per decision type)
- Create the one-page output format
- Build the "flag for conversation" workflow

**Resources Needed:**
- Integration with audience measurement systems
- Access to Development donor data
- Access to Underwriting contract data
- Grant/reporting document parsing

---

### Resources/Research Needed

| Resource | Purpose | Priority |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Data architecture review | Enable cross-agent intelligence sharing | High |
| CRM integration specs | Donor data for Development features | High |
| Audience measurement API | Programming intelligence features | High |
| Underwriting contract data model | Revenue risk assessment | Medium |
| Grant narrative parsing | Compliance risk detection | Medium |
| Event management integration | Development events features | Medium |
| Streaming analytics enhancement | Listener-Supporter Bridge (future) | Low (foundational) |

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well in This Session
- **Deep persona immersion** — Staying in each role long enough to get past surface problems to root causes
- **Quote capture** — The language each persona used revealed their mental models and emotional needs
- **Mid-session synthesis** — Pausing to capture "Station Pulse" and the Feature Map before continuing
- **Building on earlier insights** — Each persona's needs connected to and expanded on previous discoveries
- **The "Go Meta" pattern** — Stepping out of role to synthesize without losing momentum

### Areas for Further Exploration
1. **Host/Talent perspective** — We explored management roles but not on-air talent needs
2. **Board/Governance view** — What intelligence do board members need?
3. **Listener/Member perspective** — We focused on internal users; external user journey mapping
4. **Technical infrastructure** — Deep dive on data architecture for cross-agent intelligence
5. **Partnership models** — What types of partnerships matter most? Content, distribution, revenue?

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques
1. **SCAMPER on Consequence Preview** — Systematically expand the feature concept
2. **Five Whys on the Evidence Problem** — Dig deeper into why proof is so hard
3. **Morphological Analysis on Prep Briefs** — Map all possible brief types × data sources × output formats
4. **Assumption Reversal on Agent Architecture** — What if agents didn't share data? What if they merged?

### Questions That Emerged for Future Sessions
1. How do we handle the privacy implications of Listener-Supporter Bridge?
2. What's the minimum viable Station Pulse — can we start with just 2 agents talking?
3. How do we avoid information overload in the Daily Briefing?
4. What's the right balance between automation and human judgment in Consequence Preview?
5. How do partnership opportunities get surfaced — inbound vs. outbound prospecting?
6. How do we measure the ROI of Station Console itself?

## Architecture Implications

The session revealed a fundamental insight about Station Console's architecture:

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │  STATION PULSE  │
                    │  (Chief of Staff)│
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
         ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐
         │                   │                   │
         ▼                   ▼                   ▼
   ┌──────────┐        ┌──────────┐        ┌──────────┐
   │  SARAH   │◄──────►│  MARCUS  │◄──────►│  DIANA   │
   │ (Dev)    │        │ (Mktg)   │        │ (Under)  │
   └────┬─────┘        └────┬─────┘        └────┬─────┘
        │                   │                   │
        └───────────────────┼───────────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼
                      ┌──────────┐
                      │  JORDAN  │
                      │ (Prog)   │
                      └──────────┘
```

**Station Pulse** sits above, watching for cross-agent signals and correlations.

**All agents** share a common intelligence layer and can query each other's knowledge.

**Jordan (Programming)** receives input from all others — because every programming decision has development, marketing, and underwriting implications.

This is not just a feature addition — it's an architectural evolution of the PRD's original vision.
